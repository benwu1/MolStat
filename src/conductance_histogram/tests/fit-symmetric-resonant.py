 # @brief Test suite for fitting to the symmetric, resonant-tunneling model.
 # 
 # @test Test suite for fitting to the symmetric, resonant-tunneling model.
 #
 # The data in symmetric-nonresonant.dat was generated by the simulator with
 # the following input
 # @verbatim
 # SymmetricOneSiteModel
 # ZeroBias
 # 100000
 # 100 linear
 # 0.
 # gamma normal 0.5 0.05
 # epsilon normal 0. 0.05
 # @endverbatim
 # Note that bins with zero counts were deleted from the histogram (they cause
 # numerical problems when fitting to the SymmetricResonantFitModel).
