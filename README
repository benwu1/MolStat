Thank you for downloading MolStat. We hope you find this software helpful
and easy to use. Detailed instructions for installation, use, and extension
of MolStat can be found in the documentation files.

There are generally two files,
doc/userman.pdf -- which is a Users' manual for the standard installation.
doc/fullref.pdf -- which is a full code reference.

These files can be created from the code using doxygen or downloaded from
the MolStat website, https://bitbucket.org/mgreuter/molstat. Note that the
versions on the MolStat website will correspond to versioned releases; those
generated by doxygen will always be the most up-to-date.

The Users' manual contains the pertinent information for using and/or
extending MolStat. Alternatively, the full code reference contains all details
about the code and package.

The early pages of the two documentation manuals are identical.

Thanks for using MolStat, and please let us know if you have any comments or
ideas for improvement.
