Thank you for downloading MolStat. We hope you find this software helpful
and easy to use. Detailed instructions for installation, use, and extension
of MolStat are included in the documentation files.

There are generally two files,
doc/userman.pdf -- which is a Users' manual for the standard installation; and
doc/fullref.pdf -- which is a full code reference intended extending the
                   capabilities of MolStat.
The early pages of the two manuals are identical. Note that these files can be
generated with doxygen in the usual build path of the code.

Thanks for using MolStat, and please let us know if you have any comments or
ideas for improvement.
