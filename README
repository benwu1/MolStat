Thank you for downloading MolStat. We hope you find this software helpful
and easy to use. Detailed instructions for installation, use, and extension
of MolStat are included in the documentation files.

There are generally two files,
doc/userman.pdf -- which is a Users' manual for the standard installation.
doc/fullref.pdf -- which is a full code reference.

The Users' manual contains only the pertinent information for using and/or
extending MolStat. Alternatively, the full code reference contains all details
about the code and package.

The early pages of the two documentation manuals are identical. Note that both
manuals can be generated with doxygen in the usual build path of the code.

Thanks for using MolStat, and please let us know if you have any comments or
ideas for improvement.
